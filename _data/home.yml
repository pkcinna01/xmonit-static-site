    X-Monit was founded informally in January of 2017.  
    Paul Cinnamond is the owner and primary software developer.  He has over 20 years experience with projects
    in banking, telecom and the military.  Projects in these fields require thorough background checks and sometimes TSI (top secret) clearence.  X-Monit can provide affordable
    solutions where high security or confidentiality make offshore development too risky.<br/><br/>
    Phone, Skype, or in person consultations allow X-Monit and clients to establish trust and confidence.
