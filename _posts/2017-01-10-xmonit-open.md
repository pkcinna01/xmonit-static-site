X-Monit is established to provide automation and monitoring software.

#### Off-Grid Solar - Smart Applicance Managment
Corporations and governments have little incentive to empower individuals with electric power not controlled by a central authority.  That said, there are few tools available to manage small solar panel setups.  Escpecially when it comes to devices such as air conditioners, heaters, washers, dryers, etc...  X-Monit is developing intelligent power managment software so that appliances are scheduled to run based on power availble and what appliances are needed the most.  

#### Beyond Lead-Acid Battery Banks
Efficient battery banks will probably never be affordable. It would be socially destabilizing for any ruling class to allow people to become that independent.  That said, some creative approaches to a complete home power system can include water tanks to store energy in the form of hot or cold water and wood burning technologies.  Integrating various energy storage and sproduction systems with a solar off-grid setup can enable individuals to become energy independent.  X-Monit is developing smart software that can track and schedule various components of a system so they work together and maximize energy production and use. 

#### Chinese Equipment
China provides cheap off-grid solar devices such as charge controllers and power inverters.  Many of these devices have serial bus connectors but lack full featured software to interact with them. The cheap equipment from China is becoming more reliable and efficient.  X-Monit provides a free modbus java library to EPEver charge controllers.
