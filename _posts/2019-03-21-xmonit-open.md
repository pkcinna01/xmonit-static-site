I am happy to announce that X-Monit is now providing software development and administration services.  

At this time financial risks are minimized by performing work through UpWork or contracts (1099 or W-2).  A business license (LLC) may be on the horizon depending on feedback from clients.  Significant incentives and discounts are planned while getting established!
