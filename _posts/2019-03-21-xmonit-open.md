I am happy to announce that X-Monit is now providing software development and administration services publicly.  

At this time financial risks are minimized by performing work through UpWork and independent contracts (1099 or W-2).  An LLC license may be on the horizon depending on feedback from clients (assuming I find some).  As incentive to land a first client on UpWork, the initial hourly rate will be $3/hr for up to 40 hours of work.
