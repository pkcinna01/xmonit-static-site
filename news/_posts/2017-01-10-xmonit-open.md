##### Off-Grid Solar - Smart Applicance Managment
Corporations and governments have little incentive to empower individuals with electric power not controlled by a central authority.  That said, there are not many tools for managing small solar panel setups.  Especially when it comes to devices like air conditioners, heaters, washers, dryers, etc...  X-Monit is developing intelligent power managment software so that appliances are scheduled to run based on power availble and what appliances are needed the most.  

##### Beyond Lead-Acid Battery Banks
Good battery banks will probably not be affordable for at least a decade or two. There are impressive technologies emerging across Asia but it would be socially destabilizing for a large portion of the population in the USA to suddenly drop off the grid.  That said, there are creative approaches to becoming energy independent now.  

X-Monit is developing smart software that can track and schedule various components of a system so they work together and maximize energy production and use.
