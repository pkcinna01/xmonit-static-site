##### Business Model and Contract Agreements
Initial projects will be managed with UpWork or contracts (1099 or W-2).  A business license (LLC) may be on the horizon depending on feedback from clients.  UpWork has a well defined model for protecting both the client and the freelancer.  Contracting companies that provide W-2 employees to clients also protect the client and software developer.  While UpWork projects and W-2 contracts are safe and easy to manage, they include a third party with various charges and fees.  A 1099 contract is preferred by X-Monit if a client is familiar with that process.  In that model the client basically writes a check for services completed (a written agreement is signed by all parties prior to any work).

##### Why create a new business?
If you ever have had the chance to walk around the workplace of a large corporation you will notice there are few developers over 40 years old.  The few older developers that manage to find a role in these environments end up as project leads and eventually managers.  A few others manage to migrate to roles in DevOps or specialized application administration.  Going into freelance or creating a private consulting company is a good option for developers who are not ready to stop creating software.
